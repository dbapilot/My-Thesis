\[
(5 - 1) \times 100 = 400 \text{ ms, which is valued at } \$400 \text{ per day.}
\]

Costs involved:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maintenance cost for refreshing = \$30
    \item Storage cost for keeping MV = \$20
    \item Estimated correction cost = \$10
\end{itemize}

Total saving calculation:

\[
\text{Total Saving} = 400 - (30 + 20 + 10) = \$340
\]

This means the net benefit for using the Materialized View (MV) is= \$340
