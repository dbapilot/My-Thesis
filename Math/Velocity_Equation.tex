\begin{equation}
v_i(t+1) = W \cdot v_i(t) + c_1 \cdot r_1 \cdot (P_Best_i - x_i(t)) + c_2 \cdot r_2 \cdot (G_Best - x_i(t))
\end{equation}

\textbf{Where:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( v_i(t) \): Current velocity of particle \( i \) at time \( t \).
    \item \( W \): Inertia weight that controls the influence of the previous velocity on the current velocity.
    \item \( c_1 \): Cognitive coefficient representing the weight given to the particle's own experience (personal best).
    \item \( r_1 \): A random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, introducing stochastic behavior.
    \item \( G_ Best_i \): The personal best position that particle \( i \) has encountered so far.
    \item \( x_i(t) \): Current position of particle \( i \) at time \( t \).
    \item \( c_2 \): Social coefficient representing the weight given to the global best position found by any particle in the swarm.
    \item \( r_2 \): Another random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.
    \item \( P_Best \): The global best position found by any particle in the swarm.
\end{itemize}
