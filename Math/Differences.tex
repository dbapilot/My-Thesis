For the demonstration purpose, the percentage difference for Query 1 is calculated using the formula:

\begin{equation}
\text{Difference D in  (\%)} = \frac{W - M}{W} \times 100
\end{equation}

\noindent \textbf{Where:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( W \) is the initial value (Execution time without materialized views).
    \item \( M \) is the new value (Execution time with materialized views).
    \item \( D \) is the difference between \( W \) and \( M \) (i.e., \( D = W - M \)).
\end{itemize}

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{ D in (\%)} = \frac{114 - 69}{114} \times 100 \approx 39.47\%
\]
