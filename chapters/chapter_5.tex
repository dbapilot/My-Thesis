\section{Future Work}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \textbf{Hybrid Optimization Techniques}: Explore the integration of PSO with other optimization algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) or Simulated Annealing (SA), to further improve convergence and avoid local optima.
    
    %\item \textbf{Cost-Based Optimization}: Incorporate storage and maintenance costs into the optimization process to ensure that materialized views remain cost-effective in large-scale databases.
    
    %\item \textbf{Cloud Integration}: Extend the solution to cloud-based database systems, such as Azure SQL Database or Amazon RDS, to evaluate its scalability and performance in distributed environments.
    
    %\item \textbf{Machine Learning for Adaptive PSO}: Use machine learning techniques to adaptively adjust PSO parameters based on historical performance data, improving the efficiency of the optimization process.
    
    %\item \textbf{Benchmarking with Standard Datasets}: Evaluate the proposed approach using standard benchmarking datasets, such as TPC-H or TPC-DS, to compare its performance with existing methods.
%\end{itemize}

%These future directions aim to enhance the scalability, efficiency, and applicability of the proposed solution in real-world database systems.\\
