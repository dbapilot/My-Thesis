\section{Conclusion}
The thesis focused on optimizing query performance in a database system using materialized views and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The implementation involved creating a database, identifying complex queries, and creating materialized views to precompute and store query results. The performance evaluation demonstrated significant improvements in query execution times, with an average reduction of \textbf{74.56\%} across the selected queries. This highlights the effectiveness of materialized views in enhancing database performance and reducing computational overhead.

The integration of the PSO algorithm further optimized the selection of materialized views, ensuring a balance between query performance and storage costs. The results validate the proposed approach as a viable solution for improving the efficiency of database systems, particularly in scenarios involving complex and resource-intensive queries.
