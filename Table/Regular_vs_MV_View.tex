      \textbf{Requirement} & \textbf{Regular view} & \textbf{Materialized view} \\
      \hline
      Complex Queries & Not ideal for complex queries as it recalculates each time, useful for ad-hoc queries & Suitable, precomputes results for faster querying \\
      \hline
      Real-time Data & Suitable for accessing the most current data & Useful when data is accessed frequently and updated infrequently. \\
      \hline
      Performance & May slow down with complex queries due to on-the-fly computations & Faster performance with precomputed data. \\
      \hline
      Database Size & Performance may degrade with large datasets & Well-suited for large datasets as it reduces query latency \\
