    \textbf{Requirement} & \textbf{Regular view} & \textbf{Materialized view} \\
    \hline
    Complex Queries\ & Not ideal, recalculates each time, useful for ad-hoc queries\ & Suitable, precomputes results for faster querying \\
    \hline
     Real time Data & Suitable for the most current data  &  Useful when data is accessed frequently and updated infrequently. \\
    \hline
    Performance & May slow down with complex queries  &  Faster performance with precomputed data. \\
    \hline
    Database size & May slow down with complex queries  &  Suitable for large datasets as they reduce query latency \\
